# Vibe Coding

## Introduction

As a long-time software engineer, I am very skeptical about this new AI-driven trend called Vibe
Coding, referred to as VC in the remainder of this document. However, as a human, I feel it is
important to always keep an open mind. Furthermore, AI tooling is powerful and must have some level
of utility in the day-to-day tasks of software develoment. This document tracks my learning while
attempting to use VC.

## Goals

- How does VC work?
- What tools make VC easier?
- Is it really saving me time?
- How can I trust the output of the AI?
- What tasks is the AI bad at, and is it counterproductive at the core or simply due to technological maturity?
- How does VC integrate with my existing workflows?
- How will VC affect collaboration with other members of a team?
- What is the learning curve and how long does it take to become proficient?
- Does VC improve the quality of the code I am producing?
- How does VC impact privacy and security of my IP.
- How well does VC adapt to different programming languages.
- What are the costs associated with VC, and do they justify the benefits?
