# Vibe Coding Log

## Summary

In this session, we aimed to build a simple application with minimal control over the application
architecture, allowing the AI more freedom to implement. We designed on the fly, starting with the
idea of implementing "The Prisoner's Dilemma" as a simulation to pit competing strategies against
each other. We discussed the rules, components, and scoring strategy of the game and had the AI
implement the components.

Challenges included changing plans due to a lack of initial planning and the AI forgetting to
include type annotations. We addressed these by explaining changes to the AI and creating a
standards document to maintain consistency. Key learnings included the AI's ability to maintain
understanding throughout the session and the importance of saving changes before re-prompting the AI
to ensure correct diffs.

Overall, the session had no significant impact on the workflow as the AI handled most of the work.
Next steps include discussing how to load external Python scripts, which is an area of curiosity
regarding the AI's approach.

Additional Note: Clearly, I am using AI to generate these summaries. They are very good.  I believe
the approach of using a structured note taking approach lends to clear and well structured summaries
while also simplifying the note-taking tasks.

## Session Details

- **Date:** 04/24/2025
- **Start:** 11:00 PM
- **End:** 12:05 AM
- **Duration:** 1 hour 5 minutes

### Goals for the Session:

- Build a simple app with less control over the application architecture.
- Allow the AI more freedom to implement.
- Design on the fly, with no plan going in outside of an idea.

### Tools Used:

- GitLab Copilot
- Avante

### Summary of Activities:

- Started implementing "The Prisoner's Dilemma" as a simulation that would pit competing strategies against each other.
- Discussed the rules of the game, the different components in the game, and the scoring strategy.
- Had the AI implement the components that we discussed.

### Challenges Encountered:

- Changed my mind on things a few times due to a lack of planning.
- The AI kept forgetting to include type annotations on method parameters and private members.

### Solutions or Workarounds:

- Explained the changes to the AI and let it fix them.
- Created a short standards document and kept it in context during the remainder of the session.

### Key Learnings:

- The AI maintained a good understanding of the game we designed from the beginning to the end of our session.
- Make sure to save changes before you re-prompt the AI. If you don't, your diffs will be incorrect.
- The AI handled changes to our plan rather well, even keeping track over multiple changes.

### Impact on Workflow:

- No impact. I let the AI do all the work.

### Next Steps:

- Discuss how to load external Python scripts. I am very curious about how the AI will approach this.

### Questions

- None
