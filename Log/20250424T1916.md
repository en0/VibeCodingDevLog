# Vibe Coding Log

## Summary

In this session, the focus was on generating more code per cycle and allowing the AI to handle the
details. The "Prisoner's Dilemma" card game was completed using interfaces to guide code
development. The AI was given more flexibility, resulting in larger code edits and the successful
implementation of 10 different Prisoner strategies in one pass. Challenges included the AI ceasing
to produce diffs, which was resolved by specifying the file for the code. Key learnings highlighted
the importance of interfaces in providing guardrails for code generation and facilitating easy
refactors. The session significantly sped up the workflow, and future steps include leveraging
interface-driven AI coding in the dfctl project and testing the time delta between related tasks.

## Session Details

- **Date:** 04/24/2025
- **Start:** 07:16 PM
- **End:** 11:25 PM
- **Duration:** 4 hours 08 minutes

### Goals for the Session:

- Generate more code per cycle.
- Let the AI deal with the details.

### Tools Used:

- GitHub Copilot
- Avante

### Summary of Activities:

- Completed the "Prisoner's Dilemma" card game.
- Used interfaces to drive the direction of the code development.
- Allowed AI much more flexibility in code edits.
- Made much larger code edits.
- Implemented 10 different Prisoner strategies in one pass; they all worked on the first try.

### Challenges Encountered:

- The AI stopped producing diffs at some point.

### Solutions or Workarounds:

- Telling the AI it was not producing diffs and specifying the file for the code fixed the issue.

### Key Learnings:

- Interfaces provide significant guardrails on code generation.
- With clear interfaces and module docstrings, the AI was able to implement multiple things accurately at once.
- Interfaces allowed for easy refactors. Request refactors to the interface first.

### Impact on Workflow:

- This was a massive speedup. My workflow improved drastically from other sessions.

### Next Steps:

- Return to the dfctl project to leverage interface-driven AI coding to prove the time benefit.
- Find a way to test the time delta between related tasks. Is AI really faster?

### Questions

- How can I test the time delta?


### Example prompt

In this session, I used rather large prompts that asked for a lot of changes. Here is an example:

> Ok. I am realizing a problem when I run this. The player labels on the output of "Player 1" and
> "Player 2" are not ideal. It's confusing to remember which is which. Let's add a new method to the
> Player interface to "get_name" which will return the name of the strategy. Then, in each of our
> example strategies, implement that function (don't forget the @override decorator) and return the
> name of the strategy. Then, modify the main function to use the name when printing the results.

The AI modified existing code and successfully implemented it correctly.
