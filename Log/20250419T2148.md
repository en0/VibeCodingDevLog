# Vibe Coding Log

## Summary

During this session, I focused on ideating transaction consistency for atomic operations in the
`dfctl` project. The primary goal was to determine the best pattern to ensure data consistency in
the event of failed writes. I engaged with GitHub Copilot to explore various approaches, including
ad-hoc methods and formal strategies like Unit of Work (UoW), Two-Phase Commit (2PC), and
Compensating Transactions (CO). The AI was instrumental in generating notes and validating a simple
CO solution. Despite challenges with web searches, the session highlighted the effectiveness of AI
in note-taking, allowing me to concentrate on understanding and ideation. Moving forward, I plan to
continue implementing `dfctl` and experiment with local LLMs to assess their performance in this
context.

## Session Details

- **Date:** 04/19/2025
- **Start:** 09:30PM
- **End:** 00:00p
- **Duration:** 0h 00m

### Goals for the Session:

- Ideation about transaction consistancy of atomic operations in the dfctl project.
- decide on the best pattern to ensure data consistancy on failed writes.

### Tools Used:

- Github Copilot

### Summary of Activities:

- I spoke with the AI about several options for transaction consistancy in the add_file operation.
  We discussed ad-hoc approaches and formal approaches including UoW, 2pc, and compensating
  transactions (CO).
- The AI helped generate notes for our conversation and validated an example of a simple CO
  solution.

### Challenges Encountered:

- The AI failed to do websearches during our conversation.

### Solutions or Workarounds:

- [Note any solutions or workarounds you found]

### Key Learnings:

- Github's copilot is very good and consolidating notes. I had an effective conversation and allowed
  me to focus on understanding and ideation, not note taking. the ai did that for me.

### Impact on Workflow:

- I would like to depend on AI more for note taking.

### Next Steps:

- Continue to implement dfctl.
- Lets try some local LLMs and see how they do in this context.
